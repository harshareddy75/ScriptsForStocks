# ScriptsForStocks

This is a utility script in perl to find the best and worst performing stocks in NASDAQ over the past few days (by percentage)

This will get the list of all tickers of NASDAQ and get the prices of those tickers using ALPHA VANTAGE api. 

Please note that you need to create an apikey at http://www.alphavantage.co/support/# and update the value in the script before running it (replace the xxxx)
